## ✨ Key Features

### 📦 Pack Opening System
- **Three pack tiers** — Basic, Premium, and Legendary — each with configurable card counts and rarity weights
- **Interactive tear animation** with a drag-to-open mechanic and progress indicator
- **Sequential card reveal** — click each card individually to flip and reveal it
- **Misprint cards** — rare alternate variants with their own rarity tier and higher value
- **Damaged cards** — low-value cards that can be discarded for a small payout

### 🎴 Card Collection & Rarity
- **Six rarity tiers**: Common, Uncommon, Rare, Ultra Rare, Misprint, and Damaged, each with a unique colour and value
- **Holographic sheen** on Rare, Ultra Rare, and Misprint cards
- **Per-card print numbering** — a global counter tracks how many of each card have ever been created, so low print numbers carry real prestige
- **Custom image support** — cards can use GTA V vehicle CDN images or your own custom artwork
- **Custom backgrounds** per card or per set for full visual flexibility

### 📚 Card Binder
- **Physical binder UI** with a spine, rings, and a set contents panel
- **Drag cards in and out** of binder slots directly from the inventory
- **Set progress tracking** — shows how many cards of each set you've collected
- **Drag-to-remove zone** at the top of the binder page to return cards to your inventory
- **Persistent storage** — binder contents survive restarts via the database

### 🏪 Card Dealer Shop (NPC)
- **Ambient dealer NPC** spawned at a configurable world location with a map blip
- **E-key interaction prompt** when the player is within range
- **Sell individual cards** — select any combination from your inventory and see a live price total before confirming
- **Sell an entire set at once** for a configurable set-completion bonus multiplier
- **Configurable sell multiplier** applied to each card's base rarity value

### 🗄️ Persistent Database
- **Automatic table creation** on first resource start — no manual SQL import needed
- **Three tables**: `mnc_trading_cards` (inventory cards), `mnc_binders` (binder ownership), `mnc_binder_cards` (stored cards)
- **Auto-migration** adds new columns to existing installs safely
- **Print counter persistence** — global card print counts are loaded from the database on start so numbering is accurate across restarts

### 🖥️ Polished NUI
- Custom fonts (Bebas Neue, Barlow Condensed) for an authentic card-game aesthetic
- Fully mouse-driven with ESC-key or close button support
- Modular screen system — Pack Open, Pack Reveal, Single Card View, Binder, and Shop each have their own UI layer

---

## ⚙️ Configuration Guide

### 🎁 Pack Configuration

```lua
Config.Packs = {
    ['card_pack_basic'] = {
        label          = 'Basic Card Pack',
        cardCount      = 3,           -- cards per pack
        weights        = { common = 70, uncommon = 27, rare = 2, ultraRare = 1 },
        misprintChance = 0.5,         -- % chance any card is a misprint
        damagedChance  = 5,           -- % chance any card is damaged
    },
    -- Add more pack types as needed
}
```

### 💎 Rarity Configuration

```lua
Config.Rarities = {
    common    = { label = 'Common',     color = '#a0a0a0', holo = false, value = 10   },
    uncommon  = { label = 'Uncommon',   color = '#4ade80', holo = false, value = 50   },
    rare      = { label = 'Rare',       color = '#60a5fa', holo = true,  value = 100  },
    ultraRare = { label = 'Ultra Rare', color = '#f59e0b', holo = true,  value = 500  },
    misprint  = { label = 'Misprint',   color = '#e040fb', holo = true,  value = 1000 },
    damaged   = { label = 'Damaged',    color = '#ef5350', holo = false, value = 5    },
}
```

### 🏪 Shop Configuration

```lua
Config.Shop = {
    coords              = vector3(-1288.06, -310.31, 36.65),
    heading             = 360.0,
    blipSprite          = 500,
    blipColor           = 5,
    blipScale           = 0.8,
    blipName            = 'Card Dealer',
    sellMultiplier      = 0.8,    -- cards sell for 80% of their base value
    setCompletionBonus  = 1.25,   -- 25% bonus when selling a complete set
}
```

### 🗂️ Card Set Configuration

Sets are defined in `Config.Sets`. Each card supports:

| Field | Description |
|-------|-------------|
| `number` | Sequential card number within the set |
| `name` | Display name shown on the card |
| `model` | GTA V vehicle model name (used for automatic CDN image) |
| `image` | Custom foreground image path e.g. `'images/mycard.png'` |
| `background` | Custom background image path e.g. `'images/bg_rhino.png'` |
| `rarity` | `'common'`, `'uncommon'`, `'rare'`, or `'ultraRare'` |
| `printNum` | Override the print label shown on the card e.g. `'#042 / 500'` |
| `value` | Override the sell value for this specific card |

```lua
Config.Sets = {
    ['military'] = {
        label = 'Military Forces',
        icon  = '🎖️',
        cards = {
            { number = 1,  name = 'Vetir Troop Transport', model = 'vetir',    rarity = 'common'   },
            { number = 17, name = 'Rhino Tank',            model = 'rhino',    background = 'images/card2back.png', rarity = 'ultraRare', value = 1200 },
            -- ...
        },
    },
    -- Add as many sets as you like
}
```

## 🐛 Troubleshooting

**Pack won't open:**
- Confirm the item name in `Config.Packs` exactly matches the item name in `qb-core/shared/items.lua`
- Check the server console for errors on resource start

**Cards not saving between sessions:**
- Verify `oxmysql` is running and the connection string is correct
- Check the server console confirms `mnc_trading_cards` table is ready on startup

**Binder not opening:**
- Confirm `card_binder` is a registered useable item in QBCore
- Check that `binderId` is being passed correctly from the server event

**Shop NPC not appearing:**
- Verify `Config.Shop.coords` points to a valid pedestrian area
- Check the model `s_m_y_dealer_01` is not restricted on your server

**NUI not closing with ESC:**
- Ensure `ox_lib` is loaded before `mnc-tradingcards` in `server.cfg`

## ⚠️ Important Notes

1. **Compatibility**: QBCore only — not compatible with ESX.
2. **Card Images**: Vehicle cards use the Cfx CDN automatically via the `model` field; custom cards require images placed in `web/images/`.
3. **Legal**: For use on FiveM servers only, respect Rockstar's Terms of Service.

**Enjoy collecting on your FiveM server! 🃏**
